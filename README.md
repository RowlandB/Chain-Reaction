Chain-Reaction

==============
Purpose:
To create an RPG that allows for dynamic NPCs. Ie, NPCs that will act without being 'watched' or directly interacted with.
This should create chain reactions, hence the name.

Notes:
If NPC action A can cause NPC action B, make sure than action B can't cause A. Otherwise, that can go infinite.
